// Casio has n super powers but he is quite weak in gaining them. A villian "maurits" require K strokes of super power to be defeated. Casio knows how much time it requires to gain a super power and it is given in an array A of size n.If casio want ith super-power t times it will take (Ai * t)seconds Casio can gain super power simultaneously.
// example: [3,2,7] , k=7(this much stroke will destroy maurtis)
// casio can gain 2 unit of super power at index 1 which cost (3*2) = 6 seconds
// casio can gain 4 unit of super power at index 2 which cost (4*2) = 8 seconds
// casio can gain 1 unit of super power at index 3 which cost (7*1) = 7 seconds
// so time req for this is 8 seconds.At 8th second Casio has total (2unit + 4 unit + 1 unit)=7 unit of super power which can destroy "maurtis".
// what is the minimum time required to gain K stroke of super power to defeat "maurtis".
// Input Format

// The first input line has two integers n and K: the number of super-power and number of stroke of super power req to defeat "maurtis".
// The next line has n integers A1,A2,â€¦,An: the time needed to make gain a single unit of i-th super power.
