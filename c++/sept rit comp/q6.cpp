// In the world of CBZQQE, there is a university CBZQQE_123_WHY_? which has a coding community known as CodeRIT (don't ask me why RIT is in this name).

// There are N members in this club each member organises a contest every year individually and needs some funding from the university.

// Thanks to the documentation team all the members are very organised and they always plan the event and the required budget, so they went to the University Accounts section to get their budget sanctioned budgets can be denoted as (B1, B2, B3, B4, ..., Bn ) University has a total M currency left with values (A1, A2, A3, A4,..., Am)

// You need to help CodeRITians to determine whether the university is able to give exact budget to all members using given currencies or not.
